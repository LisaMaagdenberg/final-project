I had one color of grey yarn, so it couldn't be too detailed or have different shades of grey and/or brown. Finally, I found one. Because this was my second amigurumi ever, I didn't want it to be too difficult. The result is very cute, even though I had to make some little changes to the pattern. Like I said, I wasn't used to crocheting little parts, so mostly the ears were difficult. I changed the pattern a bit, so it would be easier for me to make it. The result: a very cute little wolf! The pattern was originally by *vrouwke*, you can find my version on the Free Patterns page or by clicking *this link*.",
